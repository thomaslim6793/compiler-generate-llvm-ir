This directory should contain files to be run by the `input_file_test_suite` in test.ml.

Tests should come in groups of related files:
- someTest.fdl: the input program to be run
- someTest.options: if present, options for compiling and running the program, one word per line
  options are
  * "valgrind" to run the program with valgrind,
  * "infer" to run type inference, and
  * "check" to run typechecking
- someTest.in: the (optional) input to your program
- someTest.err: the (optional) expected output of your program

The .err file's contents will be treated as a substring to check for: if the file is missing,
then this simply tests that the program either fails to compile or fails to run.
