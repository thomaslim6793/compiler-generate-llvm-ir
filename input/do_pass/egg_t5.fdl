# This test checks:
# 1) function input can be a tuple. 
# 2) return tuple
# 3) tail-recursion works
# 4) sequences:
#   1) check that last expression is the return value
#   new feature to test) check that sequences are executed in left -> right order

    else: f1(x1, (x2, (x3, x4), x5 + 1))

# Should output: 
# (2, (3, 4), 10)
